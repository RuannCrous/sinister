			<h1>Joyce Vincent</h1>
			<p>
			Joyce Carol Vincent (19 October 1965 â€“ December 2003) was an English woman whose death went unnoticed for more than two years as her corpse lay undiscovered at her bedsit in north London. Prior to her death, she had cut off nearly all contact with those who knew her. She resigned from her job in 2001, and moved into a shelter for victims of domestic abuse. Around the same time, she began to reduce contact with friends and family. She died sometime in December 2003. Her remains were discovered on 25 January 2006, with the cause of death believed to be either an asthma attack or complications from a recent peptic ulcer.

			Joyce Vincent was born in London's Hammersmith area on 19 October 1965 and raised near Fulham Palace Road.[1] Her parents had emigrated to London from Grenada; she was of Dougla descent. Her father, Lawrence, was a carpenter of African descent and her mother, Lyris, was of Indian descent.[1] Following an operation, her mother died when Vincent was 11, and her four older sisters took responsibility for her upbringing.[1][2] She had a strained relationship with her emotionally distant father, who she claimed had died in 2001 (he actually died in 2004, unaware that Vincent had predeceased him).[3][4] She attended Melcombe Primary School and Fulham Gilliatt School for Girls, and left school at age sixteen with no qualifications.[5] She had a wide circle of friends in the music industry and when she was 25, she attended and was video recorded in the backstage audience at the 1990 Wembley Concert, 'Nelson Mandela, International Tribute For a Free South Africa.' (BFI National Archive) Reportedly, she met Mandela at the concert and shook his hand.[1][5] <a href="#">Read More...</a></p>
